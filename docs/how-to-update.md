# how to update liveness

This doc will guide you to how to update liveness models and other files on server.


## Steps:

### 1. Stop liveness systemd service:

Before updating liveness models stop liveness service first.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ sudo systemctl stop liveness_api
```
</div>

and you can check stopped status by running command

<div class="termy">

```console
$ sudo systemctl status liveness_api
```
</div>


## 2. Update models:
    
Put updated liveness models inside folder `/usr/share/face_recognition/models/liveness/`


## 3. Update 'liveness_api' binary file :

If you made changes in code, then you can re-build liveness on local system and you can upload newly generated binary files to server.

1. Rebuild code on local system

2. Replace existing binary files on server by uploading  generated binary file `liveness_api` to server inside folder `/opt/liveness_serve/`.



### 4. Start liveness systemd service:

After updating liveness you can now start liveness service.

<div class="termy">

```console
$ sudo systemctl start liveness_api
```
</div>

and you can check status by running command

<div class="termy">

```console
$ sudo systemctl status liveness_api
```
</div>
