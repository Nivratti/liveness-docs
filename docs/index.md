# Passive Face Liveness Verification Solution

Welcome to the official page for our **Passive Face Liveness Verification Solution**! This solution leverages AI and computer vision techniques to ensure secure and frictionless identity verification.

## Overview
Passive face liveness verification determines whether a face presented to the camera is real (from a live person) or fake (such as a photo, video, or mask) without requiring any user action. This solution is ideal for seamless user onboarding, enhancing security, and reducing fraud in industries like banking, fintech, telecom, and e-commerce.

## How It Works
1. **Capture**: A face image is captured through the user’s device.
2. **Preprocessing**: The captured data is analyzed and preprocessed to ensure quality and compatibility.
3. **AI Analysis**: Deep learning algorithms evaluate the input to detect signs of liveness or spoofing.
4. **Result**: A liveness score is generated, indicating whether the face is genuine or fake.
